# 📝 Keeper App

A clean and functional note-taking app built with **React**, designed to help users save their ideas and important thoughts conveniently. This app is inspired by the classic "Google Keep" layout, enhanced with **dynamic font resizing** and a **dark/light theme switcher**.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add and delete notes dynamically  
- 🌙 Toggle between **light** and **dark** (night vision) modes  
- 🔠 Increase or decrease font size with A+ / A- buttons  
- 🎯 Keyboard shortcuts:
  - Press `Enter` in the idea input to move to the description
  - Press `Enter` in the description box to add the note directly  
- ♻️ Real-time updates without refreshing the page

## 🛠️ Built With

- **React.js** (Functional Components + Hooks)
- **useState**, **useEffect**, and **useRef**
- **Props drilling** for component communication
- **Bootstrap Icons**
- Custom **CSS styling** for theme and layout control
